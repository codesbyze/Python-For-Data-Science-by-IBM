# Python-For-Data-Science-by-IBM
This repo showcases my learning compilation with IBM's Python for Data Science course! ðŸš€ Over 500 lines of code here, mixed with my own spicesâ€”think hip-hop culture and cellular biology references. Heads up, some code involves my own docs, so you'll want to tweak those parts. Got questions or wanna geek out over Python for Data Science? Hit me up!
